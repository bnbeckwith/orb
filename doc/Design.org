* File structure

  A given project directory has a few components.  First, there is an
  overall "root" directory that contains the configuration file and a
  few subdirectories related to the components of the website.

** Source
** Templates
** Plugins
** Output
  
* Configuration

  The configuration is stored in =orb.clj= in the current
  directory, or like =git= it will search parent directories

  All it does is populate a map with entries related to configuration.

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
{ :source "org"
  :destination "output" 
  :site "localhost" }
#+END_SRC
