* Introductory Matter

  /Sigh/, another static site generator? Yeah, another one.

** Inspiration

   Obviously, inspired by Jekyll and other static site generators.

** Motivation

   I wanted to have an org-mode based blog. I found that org-mode
   export would not handle all of the cases I wanted without quite a
   bit of elisp.  And, as much as I love elisp, a Clojure project of
   this nature sounded fun.

   Also, I was turned off of other generators due to how they operated
   and installed on my various systems. A Clojure varient would have
   the ability to interoperate on more platforms easily.
